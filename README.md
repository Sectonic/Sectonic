**`He/Him`**â”Š**`Full-Stack Web Developer`** **`Artist & Designer`**

I am a 16 year old full-stack web developer and artist wanting to display what I am capable of. Coming from a background in digital art, I approached web development with a touch of creativity and design. Every project I create is planned, designed, and developed from scratch. I love working collaboratively on projects as well as forming my own. Currently my main project is building [Personality Academy](https://github.com/Sectonic/pa). I hope to see you around! :)
